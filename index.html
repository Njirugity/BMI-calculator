              <h3><b>Understanding your BMI result</b></h3> <br>
              <b>Underweight (less than 18.5)</b><br>
              Being underweight could be a sign you're not eating enough or you may be ill. <br>If you're underweight, a GP can help.<br>
              <b>Healthy weight(between 18.5 and 24.9)</b><br>
              Keep up the good work!<br>
              <b>Overweight(between 25.0 and 29.9)</b><br>
              The best way to lose weight if you're overweight is through a combination of diet and exercise.<br>
              The BMI calculator will give you a personal calorie allowance to help you achieve a healthy weight safely.<br>
              <b>Obese(over 30)</b><br>
              The best way to lose weight if you're obese is through a combination of diet and exercise, and, in some cases, medicines. See a GP for help and advice.
