            What is BMI?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women. View the BMI tables or use the tool below to compute yours.<br>
            Use this calculator to check your body mass index (BMI) and find out if you're a healthy weight. Or you can use it to check your child's BMI.

              <b>Obese</b><br>
              The best way to lose weight if you're obese is through a combination of diet and exercise, and, in some cases, medicines. See a GP for help and advice.
